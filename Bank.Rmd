#Title: "MSDS 6372 Group Project 2: Bank Project - Predicting if a customer will subscribe to a term deposit."
#Group Members: Nicole Norelli,Nneanna Okpara,Sowmya Mani
#Date: March 25 2021

#Introduction: This Project is about the Bank Market Analysis to predict if a customer will subscribe to a term deposit

#The data set used for this analysis consists of 2 Data sets:

#Bank Full.csv and Bank.csv

#Bank client data:
#1 - age (numeric)
#2 - job : type of job (categorical:"admin.","unknown","unemployed","management","housemaid","entrepreneur","student",
#                                     "blue-collar","self-employed","retired","technician","services") 
#3 - marital : marital status (categorical: "married","divorced","single"; note: "divorced" means divorced or widowed)
#4 - education (categorical: "unknown","secondary","primary","tertiary")
#5 - default: has credit in default? (binary: "yes","no")
#6 - balance: average yearly balance, in euros (numeric) 
#7 - housing: has housing loan? (binary: "yes","no")
#8 - loan: has personal loan? (binary: "yes","no")
# related with the last contact of the current campaign:
#9 - contact: contact communication type (categorical: "unknown","telephone","cellular") 
#10 - day: last contact day of the month (numeric)
#11 - month: last contact month of year (categorical: "jan", "feb", "mar", ..., "nov", "dec")
#12 - duration: last contact duration, in seconds (numeric)
# other attributes:
#13 - campaign: number of contacts performed during this campaign and for this client (numeric, includes last contact)
#14 - pdays: number of days that passed by after the client was last contacted from a previous campaign (numeric, -1 means client was not previously contacted)
#15 - previous: number of contacts performed before this campaign and for this client (numeric)
#16 - poutcome: outcome of the previous marketing campaign (categorical: "unknown","other","failure","success")

#Output variable (desired target):
#17 - y - has the client subscribed a term deposit? (binary: "yes","no")

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

#Import the Bank Full Data

#Quick Peek at the SUmmary data of the available dataset
summary(Bank_Full)
str(Bank_Full)

#Checking for Missing Data
sapply(Bank_Full,function(x) sum(is.na(x)))

#The Bank dataset has 45,211  observations with 17 variables providing more information on the Bank Clients.There is no missing data in the data set.

#Test Data set
Bank_Test<-read.csv('C:/Sowmya/SMU/03_Applied Stats/Group Project 2/bank.csv' ,sep=";")

#Quick Peek at the SUmmary data of the available dataset

str(Bank_Test)

gg_miss_var(Bank_Test)+xlab("Missing Variables")

#The Test data set has 4,521 observations with 17 variables with no missing variables

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r Analysis}
#sapply(Bank_Full, function(x) sum(x %in% common_na_strings)) # missing values using other than NA
#sapply(Bank_Full, function(x) sum(x %in% common_na_numbers)) # missing values using other than NA
#sapply(Bank_Full, function(x) sum(is.na(x)))
#sapply(Bank_Full, function(x) sum(x %in% 'unknown'))

#Analysing the data with plots
Bank_Full%>%ggplot(aes(x=balance))+geom_histogram()+ scale_x_log10()

#log of balance shows the data is normally distributed

#Analysing the age and balance
Bank_Full%>%ggplot(aes(x=age,y=balance))+geom_point()+geom_smooth()

Bank_Full%>%ggplot(aes(x=balance,fill=job))+geom_histogram()+ scale_x_log10()

Bank_Full%>%ggplot(aes(x=marital,y=balance,fill=marital))+geom_col()

Bank_Full%>%ggplot(aes(x=job,y=balance,fill=job))+geom_col()

Bank_Full%>%ggplot(aes(x=housing,y=balance,fill=loan))+geom_col()

Bank_Full%>%ggplot(aes(x=loan,y=balance,fill=loan))+geom_col()

Bank_Full%>%ggplot(aes(x=loan,y=balance,fill=loan))+geom_col()

Bank_Full%>%ggplot(aes(x=duration,y=balance))+geom_point()+ scale_x_log10()+geom_smooth()

Bank_gg<-Bank_Full%>%select(balance, duration,age )

ggpairs(Bank_gg)

cor.xy <- cor(Bank_Full %>% dplyr::select(balance, duration,age ), use = "complete.obs")
LE.cor <- data.frame(var = rownames(cor.xy)[-1], correlation = cor.xy[-1, 1])
LE.cor %>% ggplot(aes(x = var, y = correlation)) + geom_col() + coord_flip()

corr <- Bank_Full %>% dplyr::select(balance, duration,age) 
corr <- round(cor(corr), 2)
ggcorrplot(corr,  type = "lower",
           lab = TRUE, lab_size = 3, method = "circle",
           colors = c("tomato2", "white", "springgreen3"),
           title = "Correlations of all relevant variables",
           ggtheme = theme_bw())

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
