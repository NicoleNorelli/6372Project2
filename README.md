# DS 6372 Project 2 (Direct Marketing Campaign)

Contributers: Sowmya Mani, Nicole Norelli, & Nnenna Okpara

This analysis explored a data set consisting of direct marketing campaign information to better understand and predict if a customer will subscribe to a term deposit. We used logistic regression to build an interpretable model, and compared it with a more complex logistic regression model, a linear discriminant analysis (LDA/QDA) model, and a random forest model to obtain the most accurate subscription predictions.
